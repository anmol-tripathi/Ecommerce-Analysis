The purpose of this data analysis is to find key insights and derive meaning from it. We will try to derive some business impacting insights by trying to answer relevant questions like

* Is companyâ€™s performance improving or degrading over time?
* What are some important trends visible in the sales data and insights?
* How can we measure our performance in terms of customer acquisition and building customer loyalty?
* Can we take some initiatives based on the data to increase the sales?
* Based on data can we avoid out of stock situations?
* What kind of customer do typically buy from us?
